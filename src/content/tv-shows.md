## Los Simuladores (2002)

Four friends create simulations and bizarre situations to solve people's problems. Even though this show is quite old, many believe that is the best TV show that we had so far.

## The Simpsons

I know it's actually an american TV show. But I included it because something really weird happened with this show in Argentina: It has become extremely popular. **Everybody** has watched a lot of Simpson's episodes. We can randomly quote a phrase of any episode, and most people will recognize and remember the episode where that line was said. Internet is full of memes about it.

It has become so well known, that we kind of adopted it as part of our culture.

## Wild Tales

Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress. This movie has won [many awards](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Premios_y_nominaciones_de_Relatos_Salvajes) and it's possibly one of the best we have right now.
