## The Simpsons

I know it's actually an american TV show. But I included it because something really weird happened with this show in Argentina: It has become extremely popular. **Everybody** has watched a lot of Simpson's episodes. We can randomnly quote a small phrase of any episode, and most people will recognize and remember the episode where that line was said.

It has become so well known, that we kind of adopted it as part of our culture.
