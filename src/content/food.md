## Mate

Mate is an Argentinian infusion (kind of the english equivalent of tea). We have mate for breakfast, snack. It's very common to invite friends over and share mate to talk and catch up with each other.

There are many ways to drink it: Some people sweeten it with honey or sugar. Others drink it "as it is". Some have it cold.

## Asado

Our version of barbecue. We don't cook it with fire, but with the heat of coal instead. It is cooked slowly to prevent it from being burned on the outside and raw on the inside. We **never** have it _rare_. Meat can be juicy but never red on the inside 🙅‍♂️.
